    <p><date when="1888-07-10">Tuesday, July 10</date>, according to instructions from <name
            ref="CT">THE TIMES</name>, I made up for the role of shop-girl,1 &amp; with a list of
        factories in one hand and gentle peace in the other sailed down <placeName type="locRef"
            >State street</placeName> under a brown braise veil as impenetrable as an iron mask. The
        fifth place on <w type="poss">my</w>
        <w type="noun">list</w> was the <orgName ref="WLMC">Western Lace Manufacturing Co.</orgName>
        <placeName type="address" num="218" place="stateStreet">218 State street</placeName>.
        Ascending one flight of stairs I stopped to take off <w type="poss">my</w><w type="noun"
            >veil</w> and adjust <w type="poss">my</w>
        <w type="noun">eyes</w>to the low light. That done I looked about and finding a door marked
        Office of the <orgName ref="WLMC">Western Lace Manufacturing Co.</orgName> with <hi
            rend="double">Come In</hi> on the glass I complied. A young girl followed and leaving
        her to close the door I fell into a chair, the only one about, and proceeded to perspire and
        scrutinize the place.</p>
